        Matilda Sutherland cut her teeth as a DJ with a ‘trial by fire approach’ - that is, 
        no real training only playing in front of real people. 
        Adopting the MTLDA moniker in two-thousand and eighteen, her relationship with DJing has since become 
        heavily centered 
        around the energy put forth by the crowd. Enjoying the push and pull of 
        intimacy between dancer and performer, the way a DJ can hold, lose, 
        and then regain the audience’s captivation at any given time. Sutherland's late night club 
        sets mostly consist of off-kilter psychedelia, 
        hard-hitting rhythms, and a dark conjuring of movement.
    <p>
        In just three years of DJing, Sutherland has contributed mixes for Melbourne labels
        Steeplejack and Butter Sessions, maintaining a steady output of mixes and 
        radio appearances. Sutherland has graced the stages of Hugs&Kisses, Lounge and Sub Club 
        countless times, she has supported international artists the likes of 
        Function, SPFDJ and Wata Igarashi - both solo and 
        as part of b2b duo with Nat Salih.
    </p>
        Across 2018 and 2019, Matilda organized Powertrip with Female Wizard. Powertrip 
        is an anti-capitalist endeavour interested in explorative musical experiences, 
        and exposing people to new modes of being with performance and sound. Together
         they created transcendental sensory experiences in the intimacy of the Gasometer Upstairs, 
         curated an online mix series, and hosted experimental DJing platform Outer Sounds at 
         notorious venue Crazy Arms (RIP).
    <p>
        Girl On Road is the latest project, which Matilda plans to morph into an 
        electronic music record label via her own forthcoming 
        release planned for May of twenty twenty-one. What began as a digital transmission via 
        Skylab Radio has become an opportunity to support artists across 
        the globe who are pushing boundaries in their music, through heavily 
        anarchic undertones and overt politcal statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2021, Matilda plans to extend herself beyond electronic music, with a 
        forthcoming EP release exploring prior experience as a vocalist and 
        songwriter. Turning over a new musical leaf, 
        Matilda intends to build a rich career as a performing artist and composer 
        on top of what she's started through her DJing moniker, MTLDA.
