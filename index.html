        Matilda Sutherland is a songwriter, producer and DJ based in Narrm.  
        Adopting the MTLDA moniker in two-thousand and eighteen, her relationship with DJing has since become 
        heavily centered 
        around the energy put forth by the crowd. Enjoying the push and pull of 
        intimacy between dancer and performer, the way a DJ can hold, lose, 
        and then regain the audience’s captivation at any given time. Sutherland's late night club 
        sets mostly consist of off-kilter psychedelia, 
        hard-hitting rhythms, and a dark conjuring of movement.
        <br>      
        <br>
        Described by Triple j as a <i>rising talent in Melbourne's underground scene</i>, Sutherland has contributed mixes for Melbourne labels
        Steeplejack and Butter Sessions, maintaining a steady output of mixes and 
        radio appearances. Sutherland has graced the stages of Hugs&Kisses, Lounge and Sub Club 
        countless times, she has supported international artists the likes of 
        Function, SPFDJ and Wata Igarashi - both solo and 
        as part of back to back duo with Nat Salih. This year marked Matilda's first 
        solo release via the MTLDA moniker, with a rhythmic 
        minimal techno track exploring acid inspired synthesis, <I>Gaba</I>.

        Girl On Road is Matilda latest project, which she plans to morph into a record label via her 
        own forthcoming 
        release. What began as a digital transmission via 
        Skylab Radio has become an opportunity to support artists across 
        the globe who are pushing boundaries in their music, through heavily 
        anarchic undertones and overt politcal statements.

        In twenty twenty-one Matilda plans to extend herself beyond electronic music, with a 
        solo EP to be released under her birth name. 
        With intentions to build a rich career as a performing artist and composer 
        on top of her DJing moniker, the EP will explore Matilda's non-electronic influences. 
        Drawing upon experience of growing up surrounded by folk and rock music, the release 
        is a display of Matilda's deep and varied love for music.
